This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about the content available on the platform. By analyzing various attributes, we aim to provide valuable information for understanding trends in Netflix offerings.

## Project Goals
1. Analyze historical data to understand trends and patterns in Netflix content.
2. Visualize content distribution by release year, ratings, and other attributes.
3. Identify key insights that can inform content strategy and viewer preferences.

## Outline
1. **Materials and Methods**
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - i) Distribution Analysis
   - ii) Visualizations (Histograms, Bar Plots)
4. **Key Analysis Questions**

## Materials and Methods
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to Netflix content, such as titles, release years, ratings, and available countries. The specific dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle: Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhendra/Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows). The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques.

## Key Analysis Questions
- What are the trends in Netflix content over the years?
- How do ratings vary across different genres and release years?
- What insights can be drawn from the distribution of available countries?

Additionally, we will conduct visual analyses to enhance the understanding of content trends and viewer preferences.

## Libraries Used
1. **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
2. **Pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation.
3. **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
4. **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Netflix_EDA.git
   cd Netflix_EDA
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into Netflix content trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding content strategy and viewer engagement.
